      as I always call you, you are such a sweet soul, and getting to know you with time made me understand the amazing person you are.<br>
      I admire how strong you are even in the midst of life's challenges, you always come out stronger and better.</br>
      You are a friend that pulls through for everyone around her no matter the time or circumstance. I am always inspired by your resilience
      and determination in the face of things that ordinarily would have pulled alot of people off track, you always come out with a smiling face.<br>
      During our university days I always admired your leadership skills, your ability to always be in the forefront of the welfare of our class,
      your selfless services even when you are less appreciated. Thank you for always being an amazing friend, leader and colleague, and may God bless 
      your new home and shower you with his endless love and peace.<br/>
      <br/>
        Princess George.

  <h2>Dear Juliet,</h2>
  <p>
    As you step into this beautiful new chapter of your life, I just want to take a moment to reflect on our journey together.<br>
    From our unforgettable days in university where we shared laughter, and so many memories to when you always gave me your notes to study
    (you really did great for me) to where you call me out for stealing your jottings, down to our service days at Gombe where we had each other's back.<br/>
    You were literally my sister, friend and everything in between. You had my back and watched it like I was family to you.
    <p>
     I just want to let you know that you are incredibly amazing and very special to me and I am so gratefuk for every single moment we've shared together.<br/>
      I can't wait for you to embrace this new adventure in marriage(I know you will do just amazing as you have always done) and I wish you endless joy and happiness
      in your new home. Have an eventful and unforgettable wedding celebration!<br/>
        Much love from this end<br/>
        <br/>
        Faithful Allison.
