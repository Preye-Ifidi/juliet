    <p class="mb-2">
      I vividly recall the excitment we shared as undergraduates, as we looked forward to this special day. I'm beyond thrilled to see you embark on this
      new journey. Your joy is contagious, and I'm honoured to be part of your celebration.
      I'll never forget your invaluable contributions to making my wedding day unforgettable and memorable.<br>
    Your love and support meant the world to me.
    <p>
    As you begin this journey, I pray that your marriage will be a lasting and fulfilling one.<br>
    May the forces that break marriages not break yours. May God bless you with wisdom, love and laughter.<br>
    May your bond grow stronger with each passing day, and may you both be blessed with good health,
    happiness and prosperity.<br>
        Remind Mr. T that he's gained not only an amazing partner but also a community that loves and
        values you. We've got your back and will not hesitate to "throw hands" if he misbehaves.<br>
            Congratulations once again, dear Juliet. I celebrate you with all my heart.<br>
            <br>
            Chika.

      I had a tough time selecting the exact picture I'll use for this because we have almost a 
      million and one pictures together and this simple exercise just made me realise how grateful
      I am for every year spent in being friends!
    <p>
    I wish you the very best as you start this journey of another phase in life!<br>
    May the blessings of God follow you throughout this journey. May God shield you and your
    husband during this journey till death do you guys part. <br>
    Happy married life my Love‚ù§Ô∏è<br>

      As you embark on this beautiful life journey, I want to wish you nothing but the best. <br>
      I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate with you, but not too worry we'll scatter everywhere when you're back in town and of course,<br>  
    we'll spend some of Alhaji's moneyüòÇ as an omo Alhaji as you love to call me.
    <p>
    I pray that the Lord blesses your new status with endless joy, love and peace. May your marriage be filled with all the
    beautiful fruits of togetherness and may you be blessed with wonderful children. You deserve all the happiness in the world, my dear friend.<br>
    Love you loads, and congratulations on your happy married life. <br>
