      Your special day is upon us and everyone is so elated and happy. I am so glad to share this special day with you
      my Julie baby; you're that girl, always one to be admired and ever so reliable. <br>
      Today marks a new beginning in your life my dear, so I pray for God's wisdom upon you. New blessings shall spring forth in your union,
      your children shall always surround your table, they shall call you blessed, they shall call your husband favoured.<br/>
      As you grow older together, may your love for one another grow stronger. May God grant you wisdom to run the affairs of the home, in Jesus name.<br/>
      CongratulationsMrs I🎊🎊🎊<br/>

     as I fondly call you, my gist partner and the most reliable of them all. As you embark on this beautiful journey of love and commitment,
may your days be filled with laughter, your nights with romance, and your hearts with peace; may your love be modern enough to survive the times
and old-fashioned enough to last forever. Wishing you both a lifetime filled with love, joy, and endless happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Oge.
