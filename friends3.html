            Though my heart aches that I can't be there in person to celebrate
            you on your special day, please know that I will be there in

            cheering you on and wishing you all the love and happiness in the

          I'll start off by saying anybody who has got the privilege to know you
          and doesn't love you does not know good thing, lol.<br />
          You exude so much love and effortlessly step in for others even when
          there's no personal benefit for you.<br />
          Let's not talk about how you fought through what could have broken you
          and still came out victorious and that's because you're<br />
          made for greatness and no matter what, your light will always shine
          through every obstacle. I'm thrilled to share in your joyous day
          and<br />
          I pray that as you embark on this jouney, may your joy never have an
          end and your light continually shine!<br />
          Happy married life babygirl, enjoy marital bliss!!<br />
